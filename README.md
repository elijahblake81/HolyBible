# HolyBible
A text file of the NLT New Living Translation of the Holy Bible
 * I used this source:  https://archive.org/details/NewLivingTranslationBible
 * Fixed the word wrap issues and made each verse have its own line which will be easier to implement into apps for searching etc.

I've include a python Script that will open an app to provide a GUI search function.
 * Download the HolyBible.txt file and either place it in C:\Bible\HolyBible.txt or place it where you like and edit the script to point to the correct location.
